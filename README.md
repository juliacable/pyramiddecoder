# pyramiddecoder
Python decoder activity from a coding challenge.

This program uses Python functions to decode a message from a text file. Each line of the text file contains a number followed by a word. The text file will always have enough entries to complete a pyramid, and the hidden message is found by looking at the rightmost side of the pyramid.
